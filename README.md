# DTEVhacks
This app is a cross platform mobile app for the Dare to Empower App for Vhacks Hackathon 2020

The App's main features include a way to sign up for club volunteer events, and handle notifications through the phone's default calendar app. 

There is also a feature to notify advisors on whether the voluntee is available or not for a certain event and a customizable user interface that includes the # of volunteer events signed up for and a profile picture along with signup + login screens.
